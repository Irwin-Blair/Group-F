# Schrodinger Equation Simulator

This software package provides a command-line tool that can be used to simulate the Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation for an input potential function. 

ADD SIMPLE EXAMPLE HERE

Features
--------

There are inbuilt functions which can be selected, or the user can input a custom potential function.
The inbuilt functions are;
* Barrier
* Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
* Square Well
* Step

A Graphical User Interface is used for this selection/input process, which also allows the user to customise the function parameters. It then shows a GIF of the resulting simulation.


Installation
------------

Install by entering the following instructions in the command line:

`$ git clone https://github.com/Irwin-Blair/Group-F`

`$ cd Group-F`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
